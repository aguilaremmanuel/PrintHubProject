                                    streamline the printing process for businesses and their customers. The shop portal serves as the backend management 
                                    system where print shops can efficiently manage incoming orders. It provides tools for shop owners or administrators
                                    to oversee production schedules, manage inventory, and optimize workflow efficiency.<br><br>
                                    On the other hand, the user portal provides a user-friendly interface for customers to conveniently place and manage 
                                    their print orders. Through the user portal, customers can easily upload their files, specify printing preferences 
                                    such as paper type, size, and quantity, and instantly receive a price quote based on their selections. This 
                                    streamlined process allows customers to make informed decisions before finalizing their orders, ensuring transparency 
                                    and satisfaction throughout the printing experience.</p>
